Simple program for seeing what personas can be fused using your current stock in Persona 3 FES, similar to the in-game implementation in Persona 4 onward. Data on Peronae, fusion results, and skills are stored in .JSON files, and the program is written in Python 3. This is a personal project for practice with Python and JSON as well as for personal use. Inspiration and ideas for how to structure this calculator are taken from the excellent tool Igor's Index by TiredTracks (http://tired-tracks.com:8080/_Projects/Igor/)
